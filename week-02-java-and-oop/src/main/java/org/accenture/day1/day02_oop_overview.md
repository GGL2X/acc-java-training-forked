# Day 02 – OOP Overview

## Why OOP?
- Models real-world concepts as **objects** with state (fields) and behavior (methods).
- Promotes **modularity**, **reuse**, and **maintainability**.

## The Four Pillars
1. **Encapsulation**
    - Hide internal data; expose only necessary getters/setters.
2. **Inheritance**
    - “Is-a” relationships; share code via parent → child.
3. **Polymorphism**
    - One interface, many implementations; decide behavior at runtime.
4. **Abstraction**
    - Focus on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.

## Quick Recap: Class vs. Object
- **Class** = blueprint
- **Object** = instance
