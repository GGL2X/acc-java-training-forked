     * LeetCode 169 - Majority Element
     *
     * Given an array nums of size n, return the **majority element**.
     * The majority element is the element that appears **more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times**.
     * You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: nums = [3,2,3]
     * Output: 3
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
     * Output: 2
     *
     * Constraints:
     * - n == nums.length
     * - 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
     * - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
     *
     * Follow-up:
     * Could you solve the problem in **linear time** and **constant space**?
