# Data
**Data** is any piece of information that can be stored, processed, transmitted, and/or analyzed by an application/service.

Some things to expect in a Backend role:
- **Large Amounts of Data:**
    
    Data-intensive applications handle massive datasets, sometimes referred to as "big data".Â This can include structured data (e.g., database records) and unstructured data (e.g., text documents, images, videos).

**Data Processing:**
    The application must be able to process the data in various ways, including batch processing (processing large chunks of data at a time) and stream processing (processing data as it arrives).

# Data Structure
A **data structure** is a specialized format for organizing, storing, and managing data efficiently.
## Common Data Structures in Java

| Data Structure | Description                      | Example Usage                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Array`        | Fixed-size, indexed collection   | Holding 10 numbers                  |
| `ArrayList`    | Resizable array                  | Dynamic list of usernames           |
| `HashMap`      | Key-value store                  | Mapping usernames to user profiles  |
| `HashSet`      | Unordered set with no duplicates | Ensuring unique email addresses     |
| `Stack`        | LIFO (Last In, First Out)        | Undo feature in a text editor       |
| `Queue`        | FIFO (First In, First Out)       | Processing tasks in order           |
| `LinkedList`   | Elements linked via nodes        | Custom list with fast insert/delete |

# Algorithm
An **algorithm** is a precise set of steps designed to solve a specific problem efficiently.

| Task                          | Data Structure      | Algorithm Involved          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Store user info               | `HashMap<String, User>` | Key-value mapping           |
| Sort transactions by time     | `List<Transaction>`  | Sorting (`Collections.sort`) |
| Process requests in order     | `Queue<Request>`     | FIFO algorithm               |
| Search by username            | `List<User>` or `Map`| Linear or constant-time search |
| Validate login credentials    | Variables / Strings  | String comparison algorithm  |
